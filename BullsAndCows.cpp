/* Bulls and cows game

The program chooses a 4-digit secret number, and you need to guess it.
After each guess, the program tells you how many "bulls" and how many "cows" are in
your guess, interpreted as:
- Each bull indicates a digit in your guess that exactly matches the value and
position of a digit in the program's secret number.
 - Each cow indicates a digit in your guess that matches the value of a digit in
 program's secret number, but is in the wrong position.
